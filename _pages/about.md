Hi, I'm Achal. I'm a hardware engineer at Nvidia working in the GPU divison. I graduated from IIT Guwahati last year, where I majored in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.

This website is my attempt at documenting at least some of the things I'm actively thinking about, as well as some random thoughts on hardware, math and tech.

Thanks for dropping by! Feel free to reach out to me via Twitter or LinkedIn if you have anything to share.
