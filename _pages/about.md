Hi, I'm Bhoomika. I am a quantitative analyst with Goldman's Securities division. I am also a part of the team at [A Junior VC](https://ajuniorvc.com), a community that analyses and documents the trajectory of the Indian startup ecosystem.

Check out [McMarkets](https://ajuniorvc.com/mcmarkets/), and do let me know what you think!

A year ago, I was an undergrad at IIT Guwahati. Worked with Dr. Arun Chattopadhyay as a thesis student.

This website is my attempt to document at least some of the things I'm actively thinking about. Feel free to reach out to me via Twitter or LinkedIn if you have anything to share.

Thanks for reading!
